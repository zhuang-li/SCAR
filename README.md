# SCAR: Style Consistency-Aware Response Ranking for LLM Instruction-Tuning

## Overview

SCAR is an innovative data selection method designed to enhance instruction-tuning for large language models. It
leverages style consistency-aware response ranking to improve the quality and efficiency of the training data.

## Installation

You can install SCAR using pip:

```bash
pip install scar
```

## Requirements

SCAR requires the following
dependencies: `torch`, `transformers`, `scikit-learn`, `tqdm`, `nltk`, `datasketch`, `peft`, `trl`, `accelerate`, `langdetect`,
and `deepspeed`. These will be automatically installed when you install SCAR via pip.

## Usage

### Basic Usage with Hugging Face Transformers

Here's a simple example of how to use the StyleRanker model with Hugging Face Transformers:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from style_ranker.ranker.model import StyleRanker

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_path = "lizhuang144/scar-gte-base"
model = StyleRanker.from_pretrained(model_path)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)

# Prepare your data
instructions = ["Write a poem about spring", "Explain quantum computing"]
answers = ["Blossoms bloom in gentle breeze...", "Quantum computing is a type of computation..."]

# Tokenize the inputs
max_length = 512
instruction_inputs = tokenizer(instructions, return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=max_length)
answer_inputs = tokenizer(answers, return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=max_length)
model.eval()
# Get the scores
with torch.no_grad():
    scores = model(
        instruction_inputs.input_ids,
        instruction_inputs.attention_mask,
        answer_inputs.input_ids,
        answer_inputs.attention_mask
    )

# Print the results
for instruction, answer, score in zip(instructions, answers, scores):
    print(f"Instruction: {instruction}")
    print(f"Answer: {answer}")
    print(f"Score: {score.item()}")
    print()
```

### Advanced Usage

SCAR offers sophisticated capabilities for data filtering and ranking through its comprehensive pipeline. This allows
you to fine-tune your selection process by choosing the top-k pairs with the highest scores, setting a ratio for
selection, or applying a threshold for filtering.

The `rank_and_filter` function provides a powerful way to rank and filter instruction-answer pairs. Here's an example
demonstrating its usage:

```python
from style_ranker.rank import rank_and_filter

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_path = "lizhuang144/scar-gte-base"

# Prepare your data
instructions = ["Write a poem about spring", "Explain quantum computing", "Describe the water cycle"]
answers = ["Blossoms bloom in gentle breeze...", "Quantum computing is a type of computation...",
           "The water cycle, also known as..."]

# Example 1: Using topk
topk_pairs = rank_and_filter(model_path, instructions, answers, topk=2)

# Example 2: Using threshold
threshold_pairs = rank_and_filter(model_path, instructions, answers, threshold=-0.5)

# Example 3: Using ratio
ratio_pairs = rank_and_filter(model_path, instructions, answers, ratio=0.5)

# Print results for each method
print("Top-k results:")
for instruction, answer, score in topk_pairs:
    print(f"Score: {score:.2f} | Instruction: {instruction}")

print("\nThreshold results:")
for instruction, answer, score in threshold_pairs:
    print(f"Score: {score:.2f} | Instruction: {instruction}")

print("\nRatio results:")
for instruction, answer, score in ratio_pairs:
    print(f"Score: {score:.2f} | Instruction: {instruction}")
```

## Performance

SCAR demonstrates significant improvements in LLM performance when used for data filtering and selection. We evaluated
our method using two LLMs: Olmo and Starcoder.

**Note:** Prior to applying SCAR, we filter out non-English and remove duplicate instruction-response pairs.

### Olmo Performance

| Dataset Size        | L.C. WinRate |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Full dataset (320k) | 3.86         |
| SCAR-filtered 10k   | 5.37         |
| SCAR-filtered 5k    | 5.64         |
| SCAR-filtered 2.5k  | 4.08         |

The official checkpoint [allenai/OLMo-7B-SFT](https://huggingface.co/allenai/OLMo-7B-SFT) is trained on 320k data from [allenai/tulu-v2-sft-mixture](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/tulu-v2-sft-mixture). We evaluate the performance of models trained with SCAR-filtered data using 10k, 5k, and 2.5k instruction-answer pairs. The evaluation metric is L.C. WinRate, which compares model outputs with 'gpt-4-1106-preview' using [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct) as the judger on the [AlpacaEval](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval) benchmark.

The official checkpoint ['bigcode/octocoder'](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/octocoder) is the ['bigcode/starcoder'](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder) fine-tuned on 13k data from ['bigcode/guanaco-commits'](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/guanaco-commits). We evaluated the performance using the [bigcode-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcode-evaluation-harness). The performance of 'bigcode/octocoder' is obtained from the ['bigcode/bigcode-models-leaderboard'](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/bigcode-models-leaderboard/tree/main/community_results/bigcode_octocoder_loubnabnl/metrics_octocoder). We evaluated models on four datasets in four programming languages (Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript) and reported two execution accuracies (Pass@1 and Pass@10) for each dataset. We evaluated the performance of the model trained with SCAR-filtered data with 10k, 5k, and 2.5k instruction-answer pairs.
